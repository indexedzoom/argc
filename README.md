# argc
A simple linux command line utility that prints the number of arguments gave as input.

# Steps to install
1) Create a build directory
2) Run the sconfigure file to create CMake files
3) Run the sbuild file to install to the /usr/local/bin directory

Now argc should be able to run from anywhere.

# Usage
Argc is a simple program that prints out the arguments given and the amount of arguments in total.
For more usage on linux (I don't know for other platforms), use a command as an argument and surround it in ``. E.g:  argc `ls`.
